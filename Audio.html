    <h3>Why Use Lossless File Formats?</h3>
      <p>Even though lossy audio files such as MP3 are still<br>
      the most common audio files, there are many positives<br>
      to using lossles audio files. Sush as:<a href="References.html">[4]</a></p>
       <ul>
         <li><strong>Easy Revovery:<br></strong>Having your music in a lossles file<br>
         allows you to restore onto a blank cd<br> an original cd that had been damaged<a href="References.html">[4]</a></li>
         <li><strong>Better Listening:</strong><br>
         Having a lossles audio file makes for a<br>
       better listen because nothing has been<br>
       removed from the the original song.<br>
       casual listeners might not notice the<br>
       difference but to a passionate listener<br>
       there may be a significant difference<a href="References.html">[4]</a></li>

     <h3>Examples of Lossy File Types</h3>
       <ul>
         <li>MP3<sup>[3]</sup></li>

     <h3>How does lossy compression work?</h3>
       <p>The aim of lossy file compression is to reduce to size of the<br>
          file being compressed. It does this by removing things from the<br>
          file that is deemed useless and will not affect the file that much<br>
          Lossy compression can reduce to the file size by up to 80% of the<br>
          original size of the file, whith minimal noticeable effects.<a href="References.html">[5]</a></p>
      <h3>Why Use Lossy File Formats?</h3>
        <p>Lossy compression enables even better file compression than lossless<br>
           files by removing some of the information of the audio and simplifying<br>
           the data. Of course, when doing this there will be a reduction in the <br>
           quality of the audio, but by using techniques, only the audio that is not<br>
           as important as the rest will be removed.<sup>[3]</sup> Lossy files compression is<br>
           good to use when you need a file size to be very low and if it does not<br>
           matter if anything if removed from the audio.</p>
