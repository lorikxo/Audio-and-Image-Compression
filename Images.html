    <h3>The difference between lossy and lossless compression on images</h3>
     <p>Lossy and Lossless are compresion terms that describe whether<br>
       or not, when an image is compressed, if all original data can<br>
       be recovered when the file is uncompressed.<sup><a href="References.html">[1]</a><sup> </p>
    <h3>Why is it important for web designers to compress image files?</h3>
     <p>There are many reasons why web creators <br>
       should compress their files,here is a list of some:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Bigs graphics will make your page load<br>
           slowly. This can make visitors uninterested<br>
           and they may leave your website.<sup><a href="References.html">[2]</a></sup></li>
      <li> By using large files, you effectively remove<br>
           yourself from the market of people that do not<br>
           have broadband internet (which is most users), as<br>
           they cannot load files that have a high file size.<sup><a href="References.html">[2]</a></sup><br></li>
    <h3>The effects of lossy and lossless compression</h3>
     <p>The effects of lossy compression is to reduce the file <br>
        size by removing data that isn't as important as the rest<br>
        of the data, and the effect of lossles compression is to <br>
        reduce the size of the file without have a noticeable<br>
        diffecerence on the image.</p>
